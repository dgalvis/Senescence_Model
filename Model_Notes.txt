Model Connections:
P1 -> P2 -> ... -> Pn-1 -> Pn (cell division, PP)
Pi -> A (apoptosis, PA)
Pi -> G (growth arrest, PG)
Pi -> S (senescence, PS)
A -> D (cell death, AD)
G -> S (GS)

Not Optimized Parameters:
state_num (n, number of prol) - this is usually set to 50

Optimized Parameters:
LeftPP, RightPP: P1->P2 rate, Pn -> S  rate
LeftPA, RightPA: P1->A  rate, Pn -> A  rate
LeftPG, RightPG: P1->G  rate, Pn -> G rate
LeftPS, RightPS: P1->S  rate, Pn -> S  rate
(note Pi -> X is defined by the line connecting LeftPX and RightPX)

AD: Transition rate from apoptosis to cell death
GS: Transition rate from growth-arrested to senescent

P_in_H2AX (average fraction of proliferative cells expressing H2AX)
G_in_Ki67 (average fraction of growth-arrested cells expressed in Ki67)
G_in_H2AX (average fraction of growth-arrested cells expressed in H2AX)

Cell Types:
proliferative (prol)
growth-arrested (grar)
apoptotic (apop)
senescent (sene)
